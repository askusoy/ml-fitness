# ML Fitness

This is just a simple gym website I made using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Mainly used to demonstrate front end web development skills learned from TAFE QLD. 

The website itself has several pages: an index page, clubs page, classes page, "About Us" page, and a member joining page.
The join page has a form that can be filled out, but as it is not connected to a database, clicking on the "Submit" button will not do anything.
